# My webpack boilerplate

This is my setting for webpack boilerplate.
You are able to make modules with html tags.
It is very easy to use for begginers.

### What inside?
1. Hot reloading on changes or save. (HTML/JS/SASS).
2. Importing HTML files in HTML files with new **tag** `<require path="./path/to/your/html/file"></require>`.
3. Posibility to use packages inside `.js` files with `require('package')`.
4. Minify code in build process.
5. And more... just check it out in packages.json to get more info about packeges i added to it. Same for webpack.config.js

### Do you see any problems?
Make new issue and i will look at it.

## How to use?
💾 1. `git clone` - Standard :-)
⚙️ 2. `npm install` - to install all packages.
🧰 3. `npm start` - to start your `http://localhost:3000`
💚 4. `npm build` - to build your product.
